# react-props-practice
## Why is this important?
<ul>The goal of using React props is to lessen things that are repetitive and lengthy. That’s where React components comes in to alleviate repetitive elements that is cluttering up our code making it very long and very complex unnecessarily.</ul>

<ul>So that means if you have an existing website, it's really easy to just insert a root div and then start adding React code into that particular position. <em>However, it’s important to note that we can't define our own custom attributes.</em></ul>

## Lessons Learned

<ul>In the React component world, attributes are called properties and you'll usually hear them referred to as “props” (short for properties).</ul>

<ul>The idea of props and passing them over when you create your custom components and then receiving them through the input called props and accessing each of those properties inside, in order to render a completely customized version of your component. This is why you would want to have different pieces of information in each of these reusable “card” components.</ul>

<ul><em>What you can do now is create as many of these card components as needed with different pieces of information.</em></ul>

<ul>You're using attributes from our HTML elements to use custom pieces of data to that particular element. And when we tap into an element using getElementById and we have a reference to it, then you can see it's almost like as if we have the input as an object and we're accessing each of its properties like .placeholder or .value.</ul>

## Considerations

<ul>When you're creating a React app you're not limited to just using React. You can just insert it any way you like using a div with a particular id & the rest of the file can still be worked like a regular JavaScript or HTML file.</ul> 

<ul>Remember that React is Javascript so be sure to enclose it in a set of curly braces if you want it to be interpreted as Javascript.</ul>

<ul>Whenever you're using HTML predetermined attributes, they always have to go into the HTML elements which are highlighted in different color and also in lower case.</ul>
